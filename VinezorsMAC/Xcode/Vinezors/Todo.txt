Popsorz upgrade notes:
Simon Says style -> flash up and down, can react multiple times.
Pop flash -> simultaneous vs sequential || ordered vs unordered (and exposure duration per poppy)

Popzorszors:
Multiple object tracking 
Many poppies change color. Only some are animated. Only pick the animated ones when they change.

Simon with a twist:
Rotate after light up. 

Hurdy pods:
Poppies move slowly and you keep track of their movement into the pots. + Distractors.

Potsy Turvy:
Pots change position and then you have to place them in the right pots.

NOTES:
(Bad Pot) Soft Feedback: Pots reject and spit out poppies if theyre wrong.

Vineseitz upgrade notes:
